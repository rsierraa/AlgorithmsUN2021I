The `for` loop and the `while` loop provide a way to repeatedly run a block of code repeatedly. A `while` loop will iterate until a certain condition has been met. If at any point after an iteration that condition is no longer satisfied, the loop terminates. A `for` loop will iterate over a sequence of values and terminate when the sequence has ended.
