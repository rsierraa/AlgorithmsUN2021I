We start with rate of return, mean and variance. You may think it's simple to calculate these values, however, there are number of different methods to calculate them. It's important to choose the appropriate calculation methods case by case.\n","\n","#Rate of Return\n","Single-period Return\n","The single-period rate of return can be calculated as following:\n","\n","$r=\\frac{pt}{p0}−1=\\frac{pt−p0}{p0}$\n","\n","Where r is the rate of return, pt is the asset price at time t, and p0 is the asset price at time 0."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"diSJU6T7wNNd","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1618028867190,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":545,"user":{"displayName":"Rodrigo Sierra Agredo","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gi6DZkaGij2R0Fw12nVKVTOcQbH7IsjJT4fNXXBzQ=s64","userId":"00575366523019786376"}},"outputId":"810d528b-eaad-47a0-d16a-58026874df44"},"source":["import numpy as np\n","rate_return = 102.0/100 - 1\n","print(rate_return)"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["0.020000000000000018\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"55XuFm9Gw9rM"},"source":["Let's say we bought a stock at 100, and half a year later it will grow to 102. A year later the price will come to 104. How to calculate our total return? Well, we can either deem it as a single-period:\n","\n","$r=104/100−1=0.04$\n","\n","or as a two-stage period:\n","\n","$r=(1+r1)∗(1+r2)−1=102100∗104102−1=0.04$\n","\n","Here we make calculations twice a year. It's called semi-annual compounding. How about quarterly compounding? Let's assume the stock prices at the end of each quarter are p1,p2,p3,p4 respectively.\n","\n","$r=(1+r1)∗(1+r2)∗(1+r3)∗(1+r4)−1$\n","\n","The rate of return we calculate here is called cumulative return or overall return. It measures the total return of this asset over a period of time.\n","\n","Now consider the following situation: we have two strategies: strategy A and strategy B. We backtested strategy A for 1 years and the cumulative return is 20%, while we backtested strategy B for 3 months(one quarter) and the cumulative return is 6%. Which strategy has a high rate of return? Our commonly used method is to convert all the returns into compounding annual return, regardless of the investing horizon of each strategy. We can compare the returns of strategies with different time horizon now. Since there are four quarters in a year,the annual return of strategy B is\n","\n","$(1+0.06)4=1+r$\n","\n","$r=0.262$\n","\n","Strategy B has an higher compounding annual return when we compare 26% with 20%.\n","\n","#Logarithm Return\n","In the above example, strategy A has 6% return over three months. Nominally, the annual return would be 4*6% = 24%. This nominal annual interest rate is called the stated annual interest rate. It is calculated as the periodic interest rate times the number of periods per year. It works according to the simple interest and does not take into account the compounding periods, while the effective annual interest rate is 26% as we calculated above and it does account for intra-year compounding. The effective annual interest rate is an essential tool that allows the evaluation of the real return on investment. If we assume the number of compounding periods in one year is n, the formula to convert the stated annual interest rate to the effective annual interest rate is\n","\n","$reffective=(1+\\frac{r_{nominal}}{n})^{n}−1$\n","\n","Now imagine the price of asset is changing every second or even every millisecond, the period of compounding n approaches infinite. This is called continuous compounding. The calculation formula is given below:\n","\n","$\\\\lim_{n \\to ∞}(1+\\frac{r}{n})^{n}=e^{r}$\n","\n","From the above limitation equation, we know that if we assume continuous compounding:\n","\n","$e^{r_{nominal}}=1+r_{effective}=\\frac{pt}{p0}$\n","\n","Then we take ln on both side of the equation:\n","\n","rnominal=lnptp0=lnpt−lnp0\n","Here we got the logarithmic return, or continuously compounded return. This return is the nominal return with the interest compounding every millisecond. To see how it is close to effective interest rate, recall the equation above:\n","\n","$e^{r_{nominal}}=1+r_{effective}$\n","\n","then we have\n","\n","$r_{effective}=e^{r_{nominal}}−1≈r_{nominal}$\n","\n","where the second equality holds due to Taylor Expansion and the interest rate being small. This is frequently used when calculating returns, because once we take the logarithm of asset prices, we can calculate the logarithm return by simply doing a subtraction. Here we use Apple stock prices as an example:\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"_2LbQkUywNNr","outputId":"64c5d980-50c7-4161-b2d6-2ab5d07ef3bc"},"source":["import numpy as np\n","import quandl\n","quandl.ApiConfig.api_key = 'tAyfv1zpWnyhmDsp91yv'\n","#get quandl data\n","aapl_table = quandl.get('WIKI/AAPL')\n","aapl = aapl_table.loc['2017-3',['Open','Close']]\n","#take log return\n","aapl['log_price'] = np.log(aapl.Close)\n","aapl['log_return'] = aapl.log_price.diff()\n","print(aapl)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["               Open   Close  log_price  log_return\n","Date                                              \n","2017-03-01  137.890  139.79   4.940141         NaN\n","2017-03-02  140.000  138.96   4.934186   -0.005955\n","2017-03-03  138.780  139.78   4.940070    0.005884\n","2017-03-06  139.365  139.34   4.936917   -0.003153\n","2017-03-07  139.060  139.52   4.938208    0.001291\n","2017-03-08  138.950  139.00   4.934474   -0.003734\n","2017-03-09  138.740  138.68   4.932169   -0.002305\n","2017-03-10  139.250  139.14   4.935481    0.003311\n","2017-03-13  138.850  139.20   4.935912    0.000431\n","2017-03-14  139.300  138.99   4.934402   -0.001510\n","2017-03-15  139.410  140.46   4.944923    0.010521\n","2017-03-16  140.720  140.69   4.946559    0.001636\n","2017-03-17  141.000  139.99   4.941571   -0.004988\n","2017-03-20  140.400  141.46   4.952017    0.010446\n","2017-03-21  142.110  139.84   4.940499   -0.011518\n","2017-03-22  139.845  141.42   4.951734    0.011235\n","2017-03-23  141.260  140.92   4.948192   -0.003542\n","2017-03-24  141.500  140.64   4.946203   -0.001989\n","2017-03-27  139.390  140.88   4.947908    0.001705\n","2017-03-28  140.910  143.80   4.968423    0.020515\n","2017-03-29  143.680  144.12   4.970646    0.002223\n","2017-03-30  144.190  143.93   4.969327   -0.001319\n","2017-03-31  143.720  143.66   4.967449   -0.001878\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"waEgHJlM0zS8"},"source":["Here we calculated the daily logarithmic return of Apple stock.
